## **Section 1: Introduction**

### **The Question: What influences the success of mountaineering expeditions in the Himalayas?**

Climbing in the Nepal Himalayas is as thrilling as it is unpredictable. Home to some of the world’s highest peaks and harshest conditions, the stakes are high with at least 564 people who have lost their lives due to avalanches alone in the Himalayas (Vallangi, 2023). To better understand what drives expedition success or failure, we explore this rich dataset, which records over 10,000 mountaineering expeditions in Nepal from the 1900s to the present. The dataset includes details on peaks, routes, team composition, seasons, summit outcomes, and reasons for failure.

In this report, we focus on three guiding questions: Does hiring professional support improve success? Does where a climber come from matter? What kinds of risks dominate in different regions? 

By examining these questions, we aim to provide insights that could help future climbers plan safer, more informed expeditions.

## **Section 2: Loading data, Data preparation & Summary Statistics**

### 2.1 Importing relevant packages
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(stringr)
library(lubridate)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggthemes)
library(maps)
library(ggmapinset)
library(grid)
```

### 2.2 Loading of Dataset
```{r }
expeds <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2025/2025-01-21/exped_tidy.csv')

peaks <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2025/2025-01-21/peaks_tidy.csv')

```

### 2.3 Data preparation

We started by merging the "expeds" and "peaks" datasets using the unique "PEAKID" to associate each expedition with its corresponding peak and region. 

```{r}
expeds <- expeds %>% 
  left_join(peaks, by = c("PEAKID")) # Left-joining of the two data sets together
```

To focus on the most significant regions, we filtered the data to include only the top 5 regions with the highest number of expeditions, based on the "REGION_FACTOR". We chose to only focus on these 5 regions as these top 5 regions encompassed 848 out of the 882 expeditions (96% of expeditions)  held from 2020-2024.

```{r}
top_5_regions <- expeds %>% #identifying the regions with the top 5 number of expeditions 
  group_by(REGION_FACTOR) %>% 
  summarise(number = n()) %>% 
  slice_max(number, n=5) %>% 
  pull(REGION_FACTOR)
```

We categorised the various termination reasons into three main groups:

- Success (termination reasons 1 and 2)
- Failure due to Environmental Reasons (reasons 4 and 5)
- Failure due to Human Reasons (all other reasons). 

Other miscellaneous reasons categorised under "Others/Unknown", we decided to filter them out of our data set. 

We then grouped the dataset by region and termination reason, calculating the count of expeditions per category. We then computed the total expeditions per region and calculated the proportion of each termination reason relative to the total, providing a clear breakdown of expedition outcomes across regions. This cleaned and summarized dataset enables easier analysis of termination trends by region. 

```{r}

termination_info <- expeds %>%  # identifying all the different termination reasons 
 select(TERMREASON, TERMREASON_FACTOR) %>% 
  distinct(TERMREASON, TERMREASON_FACTOR) %>% 
  arrange(TERMREASON) 

termination_summary <- expeds %>% 
  #identifying the 3 most common types of termination and grouping them into 3 groups: Success, Failure due to environmental reasons and Failure due to human reasons 
  filter(REGION_FACTOR %in% top_5_regions) %>% 
  select(REGION_FACTOR, TERMREASON) %>% 
  mutate(termination_reason = ifelse(TERMREASON %in% c(1, 2), 
                                     "Success",
                                     ifelse(TERMREASON %in% c(4, 5), 
                                            "Environmental Reasons", 
                                            "Human Reasons"))) %>% 
  select(-TERMREASON) %>% 
  rename(region = REGION_FACTOR) %>% 
  group_by(region, termination_reason) %>% 
  summarise(count = n()) %>% 
  mutate(total_expeditions = sum(count)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(proportion = count / total_expeditions) %>% 
  mutate(termination_reason = as.factor(termination_reason)) %>% 
  ungroup() 

```


### 2.4 Summary statistics 

To provide context for our investigation into the factors influencing Himalayan expedition success, we computed several key descriptive statistics from the 2020-2024 dataset.

```{r}
# Deriving key variables
expeds <- expeds %>%
  mutate(
    success = ifelse(TERMREASON %in% c(1, 2), 1, 0),
    hired_professionals = ifelse(TOTHIRED > 0, "Hired", "Not Hired"),
    team_size_group = cut(TOTMEMBERS,
                          breaks = c(0, 5, 10, 15, 20, Inf),
                          labels = c("1-5", "6-10", "11-15", "16-20", "20+")),
    accident = ifelse(!is.na(ACCIDENTS), 1, 0)
  )
```


```{r}
# 1. Overall success rate
overall_success_rate <- expeds %>%
  filter(!TERMREASON %in% c(0, 14)) %>%
  mutate(success = ifelse(TERMREASON %in% c(1, 2), 1, 0)) %>%
  summarise(success_rate = mean(success, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  pull(success_rate)
overall_success_rate
```

The overall success rate stands at approximately 77.2%. Success was defined based on the `TERMREASON` variable, where expeditions that reached the main peak (reason 1) or subpeak/foresummit (reason 2) were classified as successful. 

We excluded expeditions labeled with the termination reasons "Other" and "Unknown" to avoid ambiguity and ensure consistency in interpreting outcomes. This definition of success was applied consistently throughout the report to maintain clarity and comparability across all analyses. The high success rate suggests that most expeditions from 2020–2024 achieved their intended climbing objectives under officially recorded criteria.

```{r}
# 2. Proportion by nationality
nationality_proportion <- expeds %>%
  count(NATION, name = "Number of Expeditions") %>%
  mutate(`Proportion of Expeditions` = round(`Number of Expeditions` / sum(`Number of Expeditions`), 3)) %>%
  select(NATION, `Proportion of Expeditions`) %>%
  arrange(desc(`Proportion of Expeditions`))
nationality_proportion
```

In terms of nationality, climbers from Nepal (14.7%), the USA (13.3%), and the UK (10.3%) represent the largest shares of expeditions. This aligns with Nepal's geographical proximity and established guiding infrastructure, while the high participation from Western countries may reflect both interest and resources.

```{r}
# 3. Proportion of hired vs not hired
hiring_proportion <- expeds %>%
  count(hired_professionals, name = "Number of Expeditions") %>%
  mutate(`Proportion of Expeditions` = round(`Number of Expeditions` / sum(`Number of Expeditions`), 3)) %>%
  select(hired_professionals, `Proportion of Expeditions`)
hiring_proportion
```

Interestingly, 81.3% of expeditions hired professional staff, reinforcing the role of logistical support as a near-universal strategy. This links to one of our main subquestions, where we explore the performance gap between hired and non-hired expeditions in detail.

```{r}
# 4. Count by team size group
team_size_counts <- expeds %>%
  count(team_size_group, name = "Number of Teams")
team_size_counts
```

Expeditions were most commonly conducted by small teams: nearly half had team sizes of 1–5 members, though larger teams (11-20+) were still present.

```{r}
# 5. Proportion across seasons
season_proportion <- expeds %>%
  count(SEASON_FACTOR, name = "Number of Expeditions") %>%
  mutate(`Proportion of Expeditions` = round(`Number of Expeditions` / sum(`Number of Expeditions`), 3)) %>%
  select(SEASON_FACTOR, `Proportion of Expeditions`)
season_proportion
```

Seasonal trends were strongly concentrated in spring (52.4%) and autumn (44.7%), which are known to offer more stable weather windows for climbing. Summer and winter saw minimal expedition activity.

```{r}
# 6. Proportion across years
year_proportion <- expeds %>%
  count(YEAR, name = "Number of Expeditions") %>%
  mutate(`Proportion of Expeditions` = round(`Number of Expeditions` / sum(`Number of Expeditions`), 3)) %>%
  select(YEAR, `Proportion of Expeditions`)
year_proportion
```

From a temporal lens, expedition activity peaked in 2022 and 2023, together accounting for over 62% of total observations - likely reflecting a rebound in mountaineering following pandemic-related restrictions.

```{r}
# 7. Count of termination reasons (ungrouped)
termination_reason_counts <- expeds %>%
  count(TERMREASON_FACTOR, name = "Number of Terminations") %>%
  arrange(desc(`Number of Terminations`))
termination_reason_counts
```

Termination reasons were diverse. Most expeditions ended in success, but among failures, the most cited causes were:

- Bad weather (78 cases)
- Dangerous conditions like avalanches or falling ice (54 cases). 

A small number of expeditions reported accidents or critical injuries (5), reinforcing the relevance of studying risk factors in detail.

```{r}
# 8. Accident rate
accident_rate <- mean(expeds$accident, na.rm = TRUE)
accident_rate
```

The accident rate was found to be approximately 1.4%, based on whether the `ACCIDENTS` column contained a recorded incident. 

While this figure is relatively low compared to the success rate, it highlights that safety risks remain present on Himalayan expeditions. Even with high success overall, accidents - though infrequent - pose serious concerns and underscore the importance of proper planning and risk management.


## **Section 3: Data Visualization & Analysis**

### 3.1: How does the use of hired professionals affect expedition outcomes over time?

This question was motivated by the frequent media coverage of Himalayan expeditions, where teams with Sherpas or guides often succeed while those without face higher risk. For instance, the 2019 Everest season drew international concern after a string of fatalities was linked to poor planning and lack of experienced support (BBC, 2019). 
We wanted to explore whether this pattern holds more broadly over time.

The key variables used are:

- `TERMREASON`
- `YEAR` 
- `TOTHIRED`

`TOTHIRED` was used to determine whether a team had hired professionals, such as guides or Sherpas.

This visualisation is ideal for our question of interest because it enables a clear, side-by-side comparison of success rates across time between teams with and without hired professionals, highlighting both performance gaps and consistency in a simple, intuitive format.

```{r}
expedition_summary <- expeds %>%
  select(YEAR, NOHIRED, TERMREASON, REGION_FACTOR) %>%
  filter(REGION_FACTOR %in% top_5_regions) %>%
  # splitting termreason into only success and failure - ignoring human/environmental reasons 
  mutate(termination_reason = ifelse(TERMREASON %in% c(1, 2), 
                                     "Success",
                                     ifelse(TERMREASON %in% c(4, 5), 
                                            "Failure", 
                                            "Failure")))  

success_hired <- expedition_summary %>%
  filter(NOHIRED == "FALSE") %>%
  group_by(YEAR, termination_reason) %>%
  summarise(count = n(), .groups = 'drop') %>%
  group_by(YEAR) %>%
  mutate(total = sum(count)) %>%  # Sum by year
  mutate(proportion = count / total) %>%  # Proportion of termination reasons for hired
  mutate(hired_status = case_when(
    termination_reason == "Failure" ~ "Hired", 
    termination_reason == "Success" ~ "Hired"
  ))

success_no_hired <- expedition_summary %>%
  filter(NOHIRED == "TRUE") %>%
  group_by(YEAR, termination_reason) %>%
  summarise(count = n(), .groups = 'drop') %>%
  group_by(YEAR) %>%
  mutate(total = sum(count)) %>%  # Sum by year
  mutate(proportion = count / total) %>%  # Proportion of termination reasons for non-hired
  mutate(hired_status = case_when(
    termination_reason == "Failure" ~ "Did not hire", 
    termination_reason == "Success" ~ "Did not hire"
  ))
  
total_success <- bind_rows(success_hired, success_no_hired) %>%
  filter(termination_reason != "Failure")
```


```{r}
ggplot(total_success, aes(x = YEAR, y = proportion, color = hired_status)) +
  theme_economist() +
  geom_segment(aes(xend = YEAR, y = `proportion`, yend = `proportion`), size = 1) +  # Lollipop line
  geom_line(aes(group = YEAR), size = 1, color = "black") +
  geom_point(size = 6) +  # Add points with dodge position
  labs(title = "How does hiring professionals determine success rate across the years ",
       x = " ",
       y = "Proportion of groups that succeeded/failed",
       color = "Success rate of teams with hired professionals",
       caption = "We excluded “Other/Unknown” cases to avoid ambiguity in interpreting success rates") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Did not hire" = "darkred", "Hired" = "#0E4732")) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 1)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 8),
        axis.title.y = element_text(size = 10, margin = margin(r = 10)),
        legend.position = "top",
        plot.title = element_text(size = 12, face = 'bold', hjust = 0),
        legend.text = element_text(size = 10),
        legend.title = element_text(size = 11),
        plot.margin = margin(10, 10, 10, 20)) +
  geom_text(data = subset(total_success, hired_status == "Did not hire" ), 
          aes(label = round(proportion, 3)), color = "darkred", vjust = 2.5, size = 3, show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_text(data = subset(total_success, hired_status == "Hired" ), 
          aes(label = round(proportion, 3)), color = "#0E4732", vjust = -2.5, size = 3, show.legend = FALSE)
```

This lollipop chart visualizes how hiring professionals impacts expedition success rates across the years 2020 to 2024. 

The plot reveals that expeditions with hired professionals consistently achieved higher success rates, ranging from 74% to 86%, whereas expeditions without professional support showed lower success rates, generally hovering between 42% and 50%. In 2021 and 2022, the failure rate for expeditions without hired professionals exceeded the success rate as the success rate of these expeditions failed to reach above 50%.

One possible explanation for the observed trend is that Himalayan expeditions have become more complex and unpredictable in recent years, making professional support increasingly vital. In 2020 and 2021, expeditions without hired professionals had success rates of only 50% and 46.9%, respectively - falling below the failure threshold - while those with hired help maintained strong success rates of 74% and 75%. This contrast suggests that professional teams were better equipped to handle challenges like difficult terrain, poor weather, or logistical complications.

Professionals likely contributed not just local knowledge and risk management skills, but also greater logistical coordination and preparedness. These factors help explain the consistently higher performance of hired teams across all years, especially during more demanding conditions.

Overall, the chart reinforces our broader research question by showing that success and risk in Himalayan expeditions are not solely determined by environmental difficulty - but also by human and operational decisions such as hiring professional support.


### 3.2: How do the conditions of one's origin country affect their success in Himalayas expeditions?

This question was inspired by discussions in the mountaineering community around whether climbers from high-altitude countries have a natural advantage in extreme environments. For example, Sherpas from Nepal are widely recognised for their exceptional performance at high elevations, often attributed to generations of altitude adaptation. We wanted to explore whether this trend extended to climbers from other high-altitude countries as well. (Bhandari et al, 2015)

```{r }

This choropleth map visualises climbers' success rates from 2020 to 2024 based on their country of origin. The key variables used are NATION (nationality of the climber) and TERMREASON, from which success is defined as reaching either the main peak or foresummit (coded as 1 or 2). Each country is shaded from light to dark blue based on the percentage of climbers who succeeded, allowing for an intuitive geographic comparison of expedition outcomes. Additionally, average elevation data from the World Population Review is used to contextualise why some countries may perform better than others.

This visualisation is effective in answering our subquestion because it spatially highlights patterns that might be influenced by a climber’s home environment. The map format makes it easy to identify regional clusters of high or low success, supporting exploration of environmental and physiological factors.

The main insight is that climbers from higher-altitude countries—such as Nepal, China, Afghanistan, Mongolia, and Brazil—tend to have higher success rates. These countries, marked within a red box, share average elevations above 5000 feet. In contrast, countries like Argentina and Canada, with average elevations below 2000 feet, show noticeably lower success rates. This pattern suggests that natural acclimatisation and regular exposure to mountainous terrain may give climbers from highland countries a physiological or experiential advantage. Conversely, climbers from lowland regions may be less prepared for extreme altitude and thus more prone to failure.

Overall, the map supports our broader research question by showing that success in Himalayan expeditions is influenced not only by decisions made on the mountain, but also by where climbers come from. Geography, climate, and elevation shape both preparation and physical adaptation, which in turn affect expedition outcomes.

### 3.3: How do environmental and human-related termination reasons vary across regions?

This question was inspired by real-world reports of fatal incidents on specific peaks - such as the 2021 avalanche on Dhaulagiri, which killed several climbers and drew attention to region-specific risks in the Himalayas. We wanted to investigate whether certain areas consistently pose greater challenges, and whether those challenges stem from natural conditions or human limitations. (Phys.org, 2025)

This stacked bar chart visualizes the breakdown of termination reasons across the five Himalayan regions with the highest expedition activity: Khumbu-Rolwaling-Makalu, Manaslu-Ganesh, Annapurna-Damodar-Peri, Kangchenjunga-Janak, and Dhaulagiri-Mukut. 

The key variables used are `REGION_FACTOR` and `TERMREASON` which was grouped into “Environmental Reasons” (e.g., bad weather or dangerous conditions) and “Human Reasons” (e.g., illness, exhaustion, or lack of experience). Only failure cases were included to focus specifically on why expeditions do not succeed. 

This visualisation is ideal because it facilitates a clear comparison of both the rate and type of terminations across regions. By showing how environmental and human-related reasons stack up within each region, the chart effectively highlights variation in risk profiles, aiding our investigation into how geography influences outcomes.

The chart reveals that Dhaulagiri-Mukut has the highest failure rate overall, driven largely by environmental reasons (35%), followed by human factors (16%). Kangchenjunga-Janak and Annapurna-Damodar-Peri also display substantial termination rates from both categories. 

In contrast, Khumbu-Rolwaling-Makalu shows the lowest failure rates (9% environmental, 8% human), suggesting relatively safer or better-managed conditions. Interestingly, Manaslu-Ganesh presents a high rate of environmental failures (25%) but only 2% due to human reasons - possibly indicating that external conditions, rather than climber readiness, are the primary challenge in this region.

Overall, this graph supports our broader research question by emphasizing that expedition outcomes are shaped by more than just raw difficulty - specific regional risks matter. Understanding whether failure stems from external hazards or human limitations helps clarify how climbers can prepare and where support systems are most needed. It reinforces the idea that both environmental and human factors play an essential role in shaping expedition success and safety in the Himalayas.

## **Overall Discussion**

Together, the three visualisations provide a holistic view of what influences the success of mountaineering expeditions in the Himalayas. From operational choices (Graph 1), individual backgrounds (Graph 2), to regional risk profiles (Graph 3), each figure highlights a different yet interconnected dimension of expedition outcomes. 

Graph 1 demonstrates that hiring professional support significantly improves success rates, underscoring the value of logistical and experiential preparedness. Graph 2 adds a physiological and environmental perspective, showing that climbers from high-altitude countries tend to perform better - suggesting that pre-existing acclimatisation and local familiarity offer a natural advantage. 

Finally, Graph 3 highlights how regional risks differ, with some areas dominated by environmental hazards and others by human limitations, reinforcing that local context matters. Taken together, these patterns support our overarching claim: success in Himalayan expeditions is not determined by a single factor, but is instead the outcome of strategic preparation, individual adaptability, and the specific challenges of the environment.

## **Teamwork**

For the DSA2101 Final Project, the workload was collaboratively distributed among all five team members based on their strengths and areas of interest. Adharsh and Yashita focused primarily on data exploration, handling data cleaning, transformation, and gaining initial insights from the expedition datasets. Amanda , Calvin, and Nathanial Teo the visualisation and analysis, creating impactful graphics, performing deeper statistical investigations, and drawing conclusions from the patterns observed. This balanced division allowed the team to efficiently explore the data and deliver meaningful insights, while ensuring each member contributed significantly to the project’s development.

```{r , echo=FALSE}
team <- data.frame(
  Name = c("Siva Adharsh", "Goh Si Xian, Amanda ", "Calvin Soe Frederick", "Yashita Makhijani", "Nathanial Teo"),
  Year = c(2, 2, 2,2,2),
  Major = c("Data Science & Analytics", "Data Science & Economics", "Data Science & Analytics", "Business & Data Analytics", "Data Science & Economics"),
  Responsibilities = c("Data Exploration", "Visualisation & Analysis","Visualisation & Analysis","Data Exploration", "Visualisation & Analysis" )
)
